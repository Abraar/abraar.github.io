        Hi, am Abraar Quraishi. I am a UX/UI designer that constantly seeks to improve my skills. There is so much in this world to learn, and so much knowledge waiting to be discovered. 
      </p>
      <p>
        I specialize in wireframes and prototypes.  I like seeing the skeleton of a project, and constantly working on it until itâ€™s time to add the finer details. To me, the most enjoyable thing about designing is taking an idea, and fine tuning it to suit the needs of the user.      </p>
      <p>
        To me, being a UX designer is being the bridge between the developers and the user. I enjoy learning about the human mind, and how we interact with the technology around us.
      </p>
